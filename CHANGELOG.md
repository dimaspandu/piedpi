# Changelog

## [1.0.5] – Custom Error Routing & Explicit Failure Control

### Added
- Router-level custom 404 (Not Found) handler via `setNotFoundHandler()`
- Router-level custom 500 (Internal Server Error) handler via `setErrorHandler()`
- Ability to render error pages using standard controllers
- Exception injection into 500 error handlers for diagnostic or logging needs

### Improved
- Explicit separation between:
  - Route resolution
  - Handler execution
  - Error recovery paths
- Router resilience against uncaught exceptions during handler execution
- Developer control over error presentation without overriding global handlers
- Consistency between normal routes and error flows

### Notes
This release formalizes **error handling as a first-class routing concern**.

Instead of treating errors as side effects, Piedpi now models them as
**explicit execution paths**, allowing custom error pages to be composed,
streamed, or served just like normal routes.

This design preserves:
- Streaming compatibility
- Framework-free architecture
- Predictable control flow

While significantly improving real-world production readiness.

## [1.0.4] – Static Asset Serving & Gzip Support

### Added
- Native gzip response support in `Renderer::serve()`
- Content negotiation based on `Accept-Encoding`
- Direct serving of full HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Optional gzip toggle per response
- Automatic `Content-Length` and `Vary: Accept-Encoding` headers

### Improved
- Separation between streamed views and static asset delivery
- Support for modern frontend bundles without external servers
- HTTP efficiency for single-file HTML applications
- Compatibility with micro and monolithic deployments

### Notes
This release extends Piedpi beyond streaming views into a
**hybrid rendering model**.

The system now supports:
- Progressive HTML streaming (BigPipe-style)
- Full static document delivery
- Optional gzip compression

All without introducing a build step, dependency, or framework-level
asset pipeline.

## [1.0.3] – View Layer Refinement & Widget Enhancement

### Added
- Self-closing HTML tag support in Widget renderer (`br/`, `hr/`, etc.)
- Recursive widget children handling (string, array, nested widgets)
- Safe mixed-content rendering (escaped text + trusted widget output)
- Asset routing support for non-public front controller setups

### Improved
- Widget rendering flexibility for complex semantic layouts
- HTML composition without introducing a template engine
- View-layer ergonomics for progressive HTML streaming
- Consistency between streamed chunks and full view rendering

### Notes
This release strengthens the **view and composition layer** of Piedpi.
Widgets can now express complex, semantic HTML structures while
remaining framework-free, stream-safe, and predictable.

---

## [1.0.2] – HTTP Layer & Middleware Completion

### Added
- Error boundary middleware for safe request execution
- Full HTTP response abstraction (JSON, Stream, File)
- Support for HTTP methods beyond GET (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- API routing separation (`routes/web.php` & `routes/api.php`)
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Basic request payload handling (JSON body & query string)

### Improved
- Router execution flow with centralized response sending
- Controller clarity between web and API responses
- Public entrypoint readability and route organization

### Notes
This release completes the **HTTP and middleware layer** of Piedpi.
The system now supports REST-style APIs while keeping rendering
explicit and framework-free.
